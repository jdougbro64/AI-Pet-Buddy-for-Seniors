# Project Title

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

<!-- Describe briefly in 2-3 sentences what your project is about. About 250 characters is a nice length! -->
Pet-like companion for senior citizens. It is a robot in the form of a pet (such as a dog or cat - like a mechanized stuffed animal) and it can see, move, and talk with the senior. It uses Gen AI to have conversations with the senior. It gets to know the senior and can help the person talk through things, help them remember things, etc., like a friend. It is personalized to that senior (via interviewing by Gen AI to get to know them) and can get to know the senior's family (online, via public info/ posts) and help the senior keep up with what their family members are doing (via public info in posts and/ or special repository family members can add to online for the senior). "AI-Pet" could also provide some safety features like detect unusual sights or sounds (intruder, things or the person falling, emotional distress, etc. and alert family/ friends/ authorities."AI-Pet" connects to the internet via in-home wifi or cellular if wifi not available. Has on offline mode too. We want this to augment the senior's social life, by keeping the person connected and able to express their thoughts and emotions when they occur, in between connections with real humans, not replacing a real social life. The AI-Pet could also come to be an advocate for the senior owner, like their agent, for things like getting and paying for health care, once it gets to know the person. 


## Background

<!-- Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting? -->

<!-- This is how you make a list, if you need one: -->
* Loneliness for seniors. We read and know of personally senior citizens who are alone and lonely, due to living a distance from family / friends and other reasons.
* Seniors may not be able to have or care for a real pet
* Concern by family members and friends about how the senior is doing, knowing they are alone/ lonely.
* Seniors could really benefit by having an advocate available at a moment's notice, providing sense of security



## How is it used?

<!-- Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account? -->

Customer chooses what type of pet (ideally can choose their pet's physical appearance such as color/ texture of "fur" at order time). "AI-Pet" gets to know the physical surroundings in the senior's home similar to how robotic vacuums explore the home floor to map it.

<!-- Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)

If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:

<!--
This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```
-->

## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
